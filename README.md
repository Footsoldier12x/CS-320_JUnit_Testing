### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    Testing is critical to ensure quality code in being produced throughout the entirety of the development process. There are many tools and techniques available for testing code such as continuous integration and JUnit testing.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    Utilizing user feedback to improve the functionality of an application is crucial to pinpointing the actual needs of the customer. There must be a way for users to report issues with a program whether bugs or UI, incorporating feedback into the development loop can help to resolve issues before the development team has to do major reworks.

### How do I approach designing software?
    There must be a clear planning phase in which all parties involve give their input to clarify the direction of the project from the start. This is a good starting point, but communication must continue to be a major focus during development to prevent the project from veering off in the wrong direction.
